                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
                        lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
                        connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core
                        set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript
                        can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                        example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
                                    browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions
                                    allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events
                                    such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
                                    running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an
                                    application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from
                                    one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                                    server.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A
                        while statement looks as follows:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
    <code>
        while (condition)
        statement
    </code>
</pre>
                    <p>
                        If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
                        the statement following the loop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns
                        true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false,
                        execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
        var n = 0;
        var x = 0;
        while (n < 3) {
        n++;
        x += n;
        }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on
                        the following values:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer true, so the loop
                        terminates.

                    <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of
                        the function keyword, followed by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The name of the function.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
        function square(number) {
        return number * number;
        }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement
                        that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The
                        return statement specifies the value returned by the function.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
        return number * number;
                        </code>

                    <p>
                        Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed
                        to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not
                        reflected globally or in the calling function.

                        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it
                        is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a
                        function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable
                        declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides
                        within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
                        global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if
                        statement.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
        if (true) {
        var x = 5;
        }
        console.log(x); // 5

                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is
                                    case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                                <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and
                                    immutable.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>and Object</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful
                        functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in
                        the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
                        procedures that your application can perform.
